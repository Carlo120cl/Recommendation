### Looking at the specs for all three laptops I would definitely recommend the *HP Pavillion*. 
1. We have a budget of $700 and the 32 GB HP is priced at $549.00.
2. The CFO's choice really only serves as an entry-level laptop with decent streaming capabilities, but not good.
3. The IdeaPad 3i is a substantial upgrade to the CFO's choice, has more RAM and better storage, and is priced at $319.00.
